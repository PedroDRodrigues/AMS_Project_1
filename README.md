# AMS_Project_1
The project has two parts. In the first part, we modeled using ArchiMate and Camunda environments. In the second part, we modeled using Enterprise Architecture. The goal of the project is to understand the differences between various diagrams, including structured use case models, domain model diagrams, state machine diagrams, block diagrams, and internal block diagrams.
